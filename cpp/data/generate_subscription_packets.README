This is the docmentation for config files as used by our generate_subscription_packets tool.

The config files conform to the format as accepted by our IniFile class.

The global section currently has two entries "zeder_instance" which selects the Zeder
instance ("ixtheo" or "krim") and "bundle_instances" which is a comma-separated list of
"ixtheo" and "rebib."

Each named section corresponds to a single subscription bundle as used by our
"new_journal_subscription" tool.  The section name is the bundle description as
displayed to our users in the TueFind Web interface. The optional "description"
entry will be skipped while processing a section.  The "class" and "except_class"
entries are special and will be explained later.  All entries act as filters as to
which Zeder journal entries' PPN's will be added to a generated bundle definition.
The only journal PPN's that will be added to a bundle definition are those whose
column values match the values specified in our config file sections.  (The
section entries must be Zeder short column names.)  The "class" and "except_class"
entries are special in that they can reference multiple possible Zeder column values
in the Zeder "class" (= IxTheo notation) column.  If multiple values are specified
the must be separated by vertical bars without any additional whitespace.
"except_class" also references the "class" column but has the opposite effect of
other column reference entries in a section in that journal PPN's will not be
included if their "class" column contains at least one of the values specified with
"except_class."
