This is the documentation for the convert_json_to_marc tool which converts JSON to MARC 21.
This conversion is controlled by an ini file based on our local IniFile class.
The ini file must contain two types of sections, a "Global" section describing various
global settings and one section each for MARC-21 fields that should be mapped from JSON.

1. The "Global" Section

2. The MARC-21 Field Section
