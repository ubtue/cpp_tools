File names in this directory must match the following schema:
- <update_version>.sh                       => Shell-Script to be executed
- <update_version>.<database_name>.sql      => SQL statements to be executed on the database (skipped if database is missing on the current system)


The <update_version> must be >= 100.
Versions <= 99 have been reserved for the old schema, which was deprecated in november 2021.
Examples for old updates can be found here: cpp/data/system_updates.old/*
The old updates will no longer be processed.

The version number will be stored in /usr/local/var/lib/tuelib/system_version,
to ensure that updates aren't executed twice. (see system_updater.cc)
