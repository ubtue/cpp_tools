# ************ README! **************
# The problem with CORE ISSN's is that they refer to the print journals but we would prefer to have the generated MARC data
# reference the online journals.  This has been accomplished by using a map (based on an external map file)  But, the
# problem is even trickier!  In rare cases it is necessary to include the publication year in the mapping.  This has not
# yet been implemented!  We could accomplish this by referencing the publication year maybe like this
# map:journal_titles_and_ppns_map{journals/0/identifiers/0,year}:online_issn,first,fallback_passthrough and updating our
# external map file.  This needs to be futher discussed.
