/** \class ThreadManager
 *  \brief Handles thread creation and cleanup.
 *  \note  Any threads managed by this class need to call pthread_setcancelstate(3) with the first argument
 *         set to PTHREAD_CANCEL_ENABLE.  Also, before the destructor of an instance of this class will
 *         be called you need to somehow ensure that your threads have completed their work.
 *         This is an alternative when you can't or don't want to use pthread_cancel(3).
