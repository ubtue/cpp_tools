 *  \brief  Represents a time limit placed upon some operation.
 *
 *  The TimeLimit class is used to keep track of a time limit placed on some opertion. A time limit is specified (in
 *  milliseconds) when the object is created.  From that point on, the limitExceeded() function can be used to test
 *  whether the time limit has been reached, and the getRemainingTime() function to measure the time left before the
 *  limit has been reached.
